<p>Requirements risks and how Agile Requirements Modeling may help.</p>
Requirement can be confused between stakeholders of any venture.
-	Confusion, misunderstanding and frustration relative to requirements are major risks to the success of any project.
-	Overboard assumptions are requirements risk we identified in the movie example in the introduction of this article.
-	The Expectations cloud; Risk of assuming that we all agree on political or religious issues. Assuming that developers and customers have the same thoughts about system requirements.
-	The risk of allowing this attitude to exist in the stakeholder environment is that valuable development resources are wasted playing a guessing game. A further risk with this attitude is that the software project is not perceived to belong to the stakeholders. Do not accept ownership and thus increase the risk of project failure.
-	Rapid development requirements risks: Developers who are not properly trained in these approaches assume that “rapid” means incomplete or haphazard: This is a tremendous risk to project success.
-	Failure to document requirements in a format that promotes clear, complete and comprehensive understanding is a serious risk to project success.
-	Strategies to mitigate requirements risks: A software process can be defined as a set activities, methods, practices and transformations that people employ to develop and maintain software and the associated products. The result is a lack of consistency in the way software is developed and maintained.
-	This lack of consistency leads to confusion, misunderstandings, development delays and cost overruns.
-	Require user involvement: Projects fail because they lack user involvement, follow incomplete requirements and specifications. The lack of adequate user involvement is a virtual guarantee of project failure.
-	Failure to recognize that faulty requirements represent a risk: years of experience have revealed that errors occurring in the requirements stage of the most difficult and costly to fix.
-	It is essential to understand that requirements or more appropriately the lack of adequate requirements can be a significant risk to the success of any project.  
-	Without sound strategies for managing change, a project will fail.
-	Even with sound strategies, stakeholders must be aware of the high cost and high risk of change.
-	CRASH: System that fails to handle exceptions effectively will not be robust and will crash when unexpected conditions occur.
-	Set of requirements, however expressed doesn’t accurately represent your users need and consequently leads your team down the wrong development path.
-	Missing a critical functional or attribute requirement.
-	Attempting to perfect requirements before beginning construction: yet for most projects, this is a mistake. 
-	Representing requirements in the form of designs: possibly the subtlest risk in requirements engineering is letting designs creep into...consequently vulnerable to mistaken assumptions.

HOW AGILE REQUIREMENTS MODELING MAY HELP?
</p>
1-	Usage model: Enable you to explore how users will work with your system. This may be a collection of essential use cases on a Unified Process (UP) project, feature driven development (FDD) project, and (XP) project on a disciplined agile team.
2-	Initial domain model: may be depicted as a collection of class responsibility collaborator (CRC) cards, a slim UML diagram or even a slim data model. 
3-	User interface model: you should consider developing some screen sketches or even a user interface prototype.
4-	It’s more defined and shows us several best practices which should help us to become more agile with our requirements modelling efforts.
5-	Present several techniques for eliciting requirements shows us the requirements techniques, description, strength, weakness and staying agile which can help us to resolve the biggest requirements risks.
6-	Common requirements modeling challenges identify common problems that many developments teams face...modeling and discuss potential solutions for dealing with those problems.
7-	 Agile requirements change management explain how requirements will evolve throughout a project. Frequently you need a streamlined, flexible approach to requirements change management. 
8-	Agilists want to develop software which is both high-quality and high-value, and the easiest way to develop high-value software is to implement the highest priority requirements first.
9-	 Project stakeholders are the only OFFICIAL source of requirements. In fact it is the responsibility of project stakeholders to provide, clarify, specify and prioritize requirements. The best people model requirements are stakeholders because they’re the ones who are the domain experts.
10-	Types of requirements: Behavioral requirement describes how a user will interact with a system (user interface issues). It referred to as functional requirements. Non-behavioral requirement describes a technical feature of a system. It referred to as non-functional requirements due to a bad naming decision made by the IEEE.
11-	Potential requirements artifacts: artifacts that are described in greater detail in the article artifacts for agile modeling. This table shows the details of each artefact and explain more the functioning of requirement adaptable to each software, that enables you to follow the practice apply the right artifacts to your situation at hand.
